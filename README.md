#### 👋 Hi, I’m @neskuld a.k.a. Ana Caroline.
- 🌎 I currently live in Minas Gerais, Brazil.
- 🛠 I'm interested in building things. Anything and everything. I just really enjoy taking projects off the ground and (when possible) bringing them to completion.
- 🌱 I’m currently working with full stack web development. I had some experience with Node and React, learned a bit about Angular and SpringBoot but quickly moved back to React and Ruby on Rails.
- 💞️ I also used my free time to learn more about micro controllers (Arduino) and my new hobby is 3D printing. I feel achieved by seeing data moving and the lights blinking.
